portrayal of complexity. Not the complication of the simple; rather ... the
revelation of the complex."   
- Edward R. Tufte

# Introduction: Raison d'Ãªtre

[`ggstatsplot`](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/) is an extension
of [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) package for creating
graphics with details from statistical tests included in the plots themselves
and targeted primarily at behavioral sciences community to provide a one-line
code to produce information-rich plots. In a typical exploratory data analysis
workflow, data visualization and statistical modeling are two different phases:
visualization informs modeling, and modeling in its turn can suggest a
different visualization method, and so on and so forth. The central idea of
`ggstatsplot` is simple: combine these two phases into one in the form of
graphics with statistical details, which makes data exploration simpler and
faster.

## Need for informative visualizations

## Need for better statistical reporting

But why would combining statistical analysis with data visualization be helpful?
We list few reasons below-

  - A recent survey [@nuijtenPrevalenceStatisticalReporting2016] revealed that
    one in eight papers in major psychology journals contained a grossly
    inconsistent *p*-value that may have affected the statistical conclusion.
    `ggstatsplot` helps avoid such reporting errors: Since the plot and the
    statistical analysis are yoked together, the chances of making an error in
    reporting the results are minimized. One need not write the results manually
    or copy-paste them from a different statistics software program (like SPSS,
    SAS, and so on).

# `ggstatsplot` at a glance

## Summary of types of plots included

It produces a limited kinds of ready-made plots for the supported analyses:

Function | Plot | Description
------- | ---------- | -------------------- 
`ggbetweenstats` | **violin plots** | for comparisons *between* groups/conditions
`ggwithinstats` | **violin plots** | for comparisons *within* groups/conditions
`gghistostats` | **histograms** | for distribution about numeric variable
`ggdotplotstats` | **dot plots/charts** | for distribution about labeled numeric variable
`ggpiestats`  | **pie charts** | for categorical data 
`ggbarstats`  | **bar charts** | for categorical data 
`ggscatterstats` | **scatterplots** | for correlations between two variables
`ggcorrmat`  | **correlation matrices** | for correlations between multiple variables
`ggcoefstats`  | **dot-and-whisker plots** | for regression models

In addition to these basic plots, `ggstatsplot` also provides **`grouped_`**
versions (see below) that makes it easy to repeat the same analysis for
any grouping variable.

## Summary of types of statistical analyses

Most functions share a `type` (of test) argument that is helpful to specify the
type of statistical analysis:

  - `"parametric"` (for **parametric** tests)
  - `"nonparametric"` (for **non-parametric** tests)
  - `"robust"` (for **robust** tests)
  - `"bayes"` (for **Bayes Factor** tests)

The table below summarizes all the different types of analyses
currently supported in this package-

Functions | Description | Parametric | Non-parametric | Robust | Bayes Factor
------- | ------------------ | ---- | ----- | ----| ----- 
`ggbetweenstats` | Between group/condition comparisons | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
`ggwithinstats` | Within group/condition comparisons | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
`gghistostats`, `ggdotplotstats` | Distribution of a numeric variable | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
`ggcorrmat` | Correlation matrix | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{red}{No}
`ggscatterstats` | Correlation between two variables | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
`ggpiestats`, `ggbarstats` | Association between categorical variables | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | `NA` | `NA` | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
`ggpiestats`, `ggbarstats` | Equal proportions for categorical variable levels | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | `NA` | `NA` | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
`ggcoefstats` | Regression model coefficients | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{red}{No} | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes} | \textcolor{red}{No}

In the following sections, we will discuss at depth justification for why the
plots have been designed in certain ways and what principles were followed to
report statistical details on the plots.

# Graphic design principles

## Graphical perception
   
Graphical perception involves visual decoding of the encoded information in
graphs. `ggstatsplot` incorporates the paradigm proposed in
([@clevelandElementsGraphingData1985], Chapter 4) to facilitate making visual
judgments about quantitative information effortless and almost instantaneous.
Based on experiments, Cleveland proposes that there are ten elementary
graphical-perception tasks that we perform to visually decode quantitative
information in graphs (organized from most to least accurate;
[@clevelandElementsGraphingData1985], p.254)-
 
  * Position along a common scale
  * Position along identical, non-aligned scales
  * Length
  * Angle (Slope)
  * Area
  * Volume
  * Color hue

So the key principle of Cleveland's paradigm for data display is- 

> "We should encode data on a graph so that the visual decoding involves
[graphical-perception] tasks as high in the ordering as possible."

For example, decoding the data point values in `ggbetweenstats` requires
position judgments along a common scale (Figure \@ref(fig:fig1)):


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats(
  data = dplyr::filter(
    .data = ggstatsplot::movies_long,
    genre %in% c("Action", "Action Comedy", "Action Drama", "Comedy")
  ),
  x = genre,
  y = rating,
  title = "IMDB rating by film genre",
  xlab = "Genre",
  ylab = "IMDB rating (average)",
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE,
  p.adjust.method = "bonferroni",
  ggtheme = hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_tw(),
  ggstatsplot.layer = FALSE,
  outlier.tagging = TRUE,
  outlier.label = title,
  messages = FALSE
)
```

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-fig1-1} \caption{Note that assessing differences in mean values between groups has been made easier with the help of \textit{position} of data points along a common scale (the Y-axis) and labels.}(\#fig:fig1)
\end{figure}

There are few instances where `ggstatsplot` diverges from recommendations made
in Cleveland's paradigm:

  - For the categorical/nominal data, `ggstatsplot` uses pie charts (see Figure
    \@ref(fig:fig2)) which rely on *angle* judgments, which are less accurate (as
    compared to bar graphs, e.g., which require *position* judgments). This
    shortcoming is assuaged to some degree by using plenty of labels that
    describe percentages for all slices. This makes angle judgment unnecessary
    and pre-vacates any concerns about inaccurate judgments about percentages.
    Additionally, it also provides alternative function to `ggpiestats` for
    working with categorical variables: `ggbarstats`.


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggpiestats(
  data = ggstatsplot::movies_long,
  x = genre,
  y = mpaa,
  title = "Distribution of MPAA ratings by film genre",
  legend.title = "layout",
  caption = substitute(paste(
    italic("MPAA"), ": Motion Picture Association of America"
  )),
  palette = "Paired",
  messages = FALSE
)
```

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-fig2-1} \caption{Pie charts don't follow Cleveland's paradigm to data display because they rely on less accurate angle judgments. `ggstatsplot` sidesteps this issue by always labelling percentages for pie slices, which makes angle judgments unnecessary.}(\#fig:fig2)
\end{figure}

  - Cleveland's paradigm also emphasizes that *superposition* of data is better
    than *juxtaposition* ([@clevelandElementsGraphingData1985], p.201) because
    this allows for a more incisive comparison of the values from different
    parts of the dataset. This recommendation is violated in all `grouped_`
    variants of the function (see Figure \@ref(fig:fig3)). Note that the range
    for Y-axes are no longer the same across juxtaposed subplots and so visually
    comparing the data becomes difficult. On the other hand, in the superposed
    plot, all data have the same range and coloring different parts makes the
    visual discrimination of different components of the data, and their
    comparison, easier. But the goal of `grouped_` variants of functions is to
    not only show different aspects of the data but also to run statistical
    tests and showing detailed results for all aspects of the data in a
    superposed plot is difficult. Therefore, this is a compromise `ggstatsplot`
    is comfortable with, at least to produce plots for quick exploration of
    different aspects of the data.


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
library(ggplot2)

# creating a smaller dataframe
df <- dplyr::filter(ggstatsplot::movies_long, genre %in% c("Comedy", "Drama"))

# plot
ggstatsplot::combine_plots(
  # plot 1: superposition
  ggplot(data = df, mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = length, y = rating, color = genre)) +
    geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
    labs(title = "superposition (recommended in Cleveland's paradigm)") +
    ggstatsplot::theme_ggstatsplot(),
  # plot 2: juxtaposition
  ggstatsplot::grouped_ggscatterstats(
    data = df,
    x = length,
    y = rating,
    grouping.var = genre,
    marginal = FALSE,
    messages = FALSE,
    title.prefix = "Genre",
    title.text = "juxtaposition (`ggstatsplot` implementation in `grouped_` functions)",
    title.size = 12
  ),
  # combine for comparison
  title.text = "Two ways to compare different aspects of data",
  nrow = 2,
  labels = c("(a)", "(b)")
)
```

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-fig3-1} \caption{Comparing different aspects of data is much more accurate in (\textit{a}) a \textit{superposed} plot, which is recommended in Cleveland's paradigm, than in (\textit{b}) a \textit{juxtaposed} plot, which is how it is implemented in `ggstatsplot` package. This is because displaying detailed results from statistical tests would be difficult in a superposed plot.}(\#fig:fig3)
\end{figure}

The `grouped_` plots follow the *Shrink Principle*
([@tufteVisualDisplayQuantitative2001], p.166-7) for high-information graphics,
which dictates that the data density and the size of the data matrix can be
maximized to exploit maximum resolution of the available data-display
technology. Given the large maximum resolution afforded by most computer
monitors today, saving `grouped_` plots with appropriate resolution ensures no
loss in legibility with reduced graphics area.

## Graphical excellence
   
Graphical excellence consists of communicating complex ideas with clarity and in
a way that the viewer understands the greatest number of ideas in a short amount
of time all the while not quoting the data out of context. The package follows
the principles for *graphical integrity* [@tufteVisualDisplayQuantitative2001]:

  - The physical representation of numbers is proportional to the numerical
    quantities they represent (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:fig1) and Figure
    \@ref(fig:fig2) show how means (in `ggbetweenstats`) or percentages
    (`ggpiestats`) are proportional to the vertical distance or the area,
    respectively).
  
  - All important events in the data have clear, detailed, and thorough labeling
    (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:fig1) plot shows how `ggbetweenstats` labels means,
    sample size information, outliers, and pairwise comparisons; same can be
    appreciated for `ggpiestats` in Figure \@ref(fig:fig2) and `gghistostats` in
    Figure \@ref(fig:fig5)). Note that data labels in the data region are
    designed in a way that they don't interfere with our ability to assess the
    overall pattern of the data ([@clevelandElementsGraphingData1985];
    p.44-45). This is achieved by using `ggrepel` package to place labels in a
    way that reduces their visual prominence.
  
  - None of the plots have *design* variation (e.g., abrupt change in scales)
    over the surface of a same graphic because this can lead to a false
    impression about variation in *data*.
  
  - The number of information-carrying dimensions never exceed the number of
    dimensions in the data (e.g., using area to show one-dimensional data).

  - All plots are designed to have no **chartjunk** (like moirÃ© vibrations, fake
    perspective, dark grid lines, etc.)
    ([@tufteVisualDisplayQuantitative2001], Chapter 5).

There are some instances where `ggstatsplot` graphs don't follow principles of
clean graphics, as formulated in the Tufte theory of data graphics
([@tufteVisualDisplayQuantitative2001], Chapter 4). The theory has four key
principles:

  1. Above all else show the data.
  2. Maximize the data-ink ratio.
  3. Erase non-data-ink.
  4. Erase redundant data-ink, within reason.

In particular, default plots in `ggstatsplot` can sometimes violate one of the
principles from 2-4. According to these principles, every bit of ink should have
reason for its inclusion in the graphic and should convey some new information
to the viewer. If not, such ink should be removed. One instance of this is
bilateral symmetry of data measures. For example, in Figure \@ref(fig:fig1), we
can see that both the box and violin plots are mirrored, which consumes twice
the space in the graphic without adding any new information. But this redundancy
is tolerated for the sake of beauty that such symmetrical shapes can bring to
the graphic. Even Tufte admits that efficiency is but one consideration in the
design of statistical graphics ([@tufteVisualDisplayQuantitative2001],
p. 137). Additionally, these principles were formulated in an era in which
computer graphics had yet to revolutionize the ease with which graphics could be
produced and thus some of the concerns about minimizing data-ink for easier
production of graphics are not as relevant as they were.

## Statistical variation

One of the important functions of a plot is to show the variation in the data,
which comes in two forms:

  - **Measurement noise**: In `ggstatsplot`, the actual variation in
    measurements is shown by plotting a combination of (jittered) raw data
    points with a boxplot laid on top (Figure \@ref(fig:fig1)) or a histogram
    (Figure \@ref(fig:fig5)). None of the plots, where empirical distribution of
    the data is concerned, show the sample standard deviation because they are
    poor at conveying information about limits of the sample and presence of
    outliers ([@clevelandElementsGraphingData1985], p.220).


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggstatsplot::gghistostats(
  data = morley,
  x = Speed,
  test.value = 792,
  test.value.line = TRUE,
  xlab = "Speed of light (km/sec, with 299000 subtracted)",
  title = "Distribution of measured Speed of light",
  caption = "Note: Data collected across 5 experiments (20 measurements each)",
  messages = FALSE
)
```

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-fig5-1} \caption{Distribution of a variable shown using `gghistostats`.}(\#fig:fig5)
\end{figure}

  - **Sample-to-sample statistic variation**: Although, traditionally, this
    variation has been shown using the standard error of the mean (SEM) of the
    statistic, `ggstatsplot` plots instead use 95% confidence intervals (e.g.,
    Figure \@ref(fig:fig6)). This is because the interval formed by error bars
    correspond to a 68% confidence interval, which is not a particularly
    interesting interval ([@clevelandElementsGraphingData1985], p.222-225).


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# creating model object
mod <- lme4::lmer(
  formula = total.fruits ~ nutrient + rack + (nutrient | gen),
  data = lme4::Arabidopsis
)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(x = mod)
```

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-fig6-1} \caption{Sample-to-sample variation in regression estimates is displayed using confidence intervals in `ggcoefstats`.}(\#fig:fig6)
\end{figure}

# Statistical analysis

## Data requirements

As an extension of `ggplot2`, `ggstatsplot` has the same expectations about the
structure of the data. More specifically,

  - The data should be organized following the principles of *tidy data*, which
    specify how statistical structure of a data frame (variables and
    observations) should be mapped to physical structure (columns and rows).
    More specifically, tidy data means all variables have their own columns and
    each row corresponds to a unique observation ([@wickhamTidyData2014]).
    
  - All `ggstatsplot` functions remove `NA`s from variables of interest (similar
    to `ggplot2`; [@wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2016], p.207) in the data and
    display total sample size (*n*, either observations for between-subjects or
    pairs for within-subjects designs) in the subtitle to inform the user/reader
    about the number of observations included for both the statistical analysis
    and the visualization. But, when sample sizes differ *across* tests in the
    same function, `ggstatsplot` makes an effort to inform the user of this
    aspect. For example, `ggcorrmat` features several correlation test pairs
    and, depending on variables in a given pair, the sample sizes may vary
    (Figure \@ref(fig:fig4)).


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# creating a new dataset without any NAs in variables of interest
msleep_no_na <-
  dplyr::filter(
    .data = ggplot2::msleep,
    !is.na(sleep_rem), !is.na(awake), !is.na(brainwt), !is.na(bodywt)
  )

# variable names vector
var_names <- c("REM sleep", "time awake", "brain weight", "body weight")

# combining two plots using helper function in `ggstatsplot`
ggstatsplot::combine_plots(
  plotlist = purrr::pmap(
    .l = list(data = list(msleep_no_na, ggplot2::msleep)),
    .f = ggstatsplot::ggcorrmat,
    p.adjust.method = "holm",
    cor.vars = c(sleep_rem, awake:bodywt),
    cor.vars.names = var_names,
    matrix.type = "upper",
    colors = c("#B2182B", "white", "#4D4D4D"),
    title = "Correlalogram for mammals sleep dataset",
    subtitle = "sleep units: hours; weight units: kilograms",
    messages = FALSE
  ),
  labels = c("(a)", "(b)"),
  nrow = 1
)
```

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-fig4-1} \caption{`ggstatsplot` functions remove `NA`s from variables of interest and display total sample size \textit{n}, but they can give more nuanced information about sample sizes when \textit{n} differs across tests. For example, `ggcorrmat` will display (\textit{a}) only one total sample size once when no `NA`s present, but (\textit{b}) will instead show minimum, median, and maximum sample sizes across all correlation tests when `NA`s are present across correlation variables.}(\#fig:fig4)
\end{figure}

## Statistical reporting

The default setting in `ggstatsplot` is to produce plots with statistical
details included. Most often than not, these results are displayed as a `subtitle`
in the plot. Great care has been taken into which details are included in
statistical reporting and why. For example, the template below is used to show
results from Yuen's test for trimmed means (robust *t*-test):

![Template for reporting statistical details](figures/stats_reporting_format.png)

APA guidelines [@associationPublicationManualAmerican2009] are followed by
default while reporting statistical details:

  - Percentages are displayed with no decimal places (Figure \@ref(fig:fig2)).
  - Correlations, *t*-tests, and $\chi^2$-tests are reported with the degrees
    of freedom in parentheses and the significance level (Figure \@ref(fig:fig4),
    Figure \@ref(fig:fig3), Figure \@ref(fig:fig5)).
  - ANOVAs are reported with two degrees of freedom and the significance level
    (Figure \@ref(fig:fig1)).
  - Regression results are presented with the unstandardized or standardized
    estimate (beta), whichever was specified by the user, along with the
    statistic (depending on the model, this can be a *t*, *F*, or *z* statistic)
    and the corresponding significance level (Figure \@ref(fig:fig6)).
  - With the exception of *p*-values, most statistics are rounded to two decimal
    places by default.

## Statistical tests:

## Dealing with **null results**: 

All functions therefore by default return Bayes Factor
in favor of the null hypothesis by default. If the null hypothesis can't be
rejected with the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) approach, the
Bayesian approach can help index evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (i.e.,
$BF\_{01}$). By default, natural logarithms are shown because Bayes Factor
values can sometimes be pretty large. Having values on logarithmic scale also
makes it easy to compare evidence in favor alternative ($BF\_{10}$) versus null
($BF\_{01}$) hypotheses (since $log\_{e}(BF\_{01}) = - log\_{e}(BF\_{01})$).

##  Avoiding the **"p-value error"**:  

The *p*-value indexes the probability that the researchers have falsely rejected
a true null hypothesis (Type I error, i.e.) and can rarely be *exactly* 0. And
yet over 97,000 manuscripts on Google Scholar report the *p*-value to be `p =0.000`, 
putatively due to relying on default computer software outputs
[@lilienfeldFiftyPsychologicalPsychiatric2015]. All *p*-values displayed in
`ggstatsplot` plots avoid this mistake. Anything less than `p < 0.001` is
displayed as such (e.g, Figure \@ref(fig:fig1)). The package deems it unimportant how
infinitesimally small the *p*-values are and, instead, puts emphasis on the
effect size magnitudes and their 95% CIs.

# Short tutorial on primary functions

Here are examples of the main functions currently supported in `ggstatsplot`.

## `ggbetweenstats`

This function creates either a violin plot, a box plot, or a mix of two for
**between**-group or **between**-condition comparisons with results from
statistical tests in the subtitle. The simplest function call looks like this-


```r
# loading needed libraries
library(ggstatsplot)

# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats(
  data = iris,
  x = Species,
  y = Sepal.Length,
  messages = FALSE
) + # further modification outside of ggstatsplot
  ggplot2::coord_cartesian(ylim = c(3, 8)) +
  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(3, 8, by = 1))
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggbetweenstats1-1} 

Note that this function returns object of class `ggplot` and thus can be further
modified using `ggplot2` functions.

A number of other arguments can be specified to make this plot even more
informative or change some of the default options. Additionally, this time we
will use a grouping variable that has only two levels. The function will
automatically switch from carrying out an ANOVA analysis to a *t*-test.


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
library(ggplot2)

# let's leave out one of the factor levels and see if instead of anova, a t-test will be run
iris2 <- dplyr::filter(.data = iris, Species != "setosa")

# let's change the levels of our factors, a common routine in data analysis
# pipeline, to see if this function respects the new factor levels
iris2$Species <- factor(x = iris2$Species, levels = c("virginica", "versicolor"))

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats(

  messages = FALSE
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggbetweenstats2-1} 

Additionally, there is also a `grouped_` variant of this function that makes it
easy to repeat the same operation across a **single** grouping variable:


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggstatsplot::grouped_ggbetweenstats(
  data = dplyr::filter(
    .data = ggstatsplot::movies_long,
    genre %in% c("Action", "Action Comedy", "Action Drama", "Comedy")
  ),
  x = mpaa,
  y = length,
  grouping.var = genre, # grouping variable
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, # display significant pairwise comparisons
  pairwise.annotation = "p.value", # how do you want to annotate the pairwise comparisons
  p.adjust.method = "bonferroni", # method for adjusting p-values for multiple comparisons
  conf.level = 0.99, # changing confidence level to 99%
  ggplot.component = list( # adding new components to `ggstatsplot` default
    ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = ggplot2::dup_axis())
  ),
  k = 3,
  title.prefix = "Movie genre",
  caption = substitute(paste(italic("Source"), ":IMDb (Internet Movie Database)")),
  palette = "default_jama",
  package = "ggsci",
  messages = FALSE,
  nrow = 2,
  title.text = "Differences in movie length by mpaa ratings for different genres"
)
```

### Summary of tests

Following (between-subjects) tests are carried out for each type of analyses-

Type | No. of groups | Test
----------- | --- | -------------------------
Parametric | > 2 | Fisher's or Welch's one-way ANOVA
Non-parametric | > 2 | KruskalâWallis one-way ANOVA
Robust | > 2 | Heteroscedastic one-way ANOVA for trimmed means
Bayes Factor | > 2 | Fisher's ANOVA
Parametric | 2 | Student's or Welch's *t*-test
Non-parametric | 2 | MannâWhitney *U* test
Robust | 2 |  Yuen's test for trimmed means
Bayes Factor | 2 | Student's *t*-test

The omnibus effect in one-way ANOVA design can also be followed up with more
focal pairwise comparison tests. Here is a summary of *multiple pairwise
comparison* tests supported in *ggbetweenstats*-

Type | Equal variance? | Test | *p*-value adjustment? 
----------- | --- | ------------------------- | ---
Parametric | No | Games-Howell test | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}  
Parametric | Yes | Student's *t*-test | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}  
Non-parametric | No | Dwass-Steel-Crichtlow-Fligner test | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}  
Robust | No | Yuen's trimmed means test | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}  
Bayes Factor | No | \textcolor{red}{No} | \textcolor{red}{No}
Bayes Factor | Yes | \textcolor{red}{No} | \textcolor{red}{No}

For more, see the `ggbetweenstats` vignette:
<https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/articles/web_only/ggbetweenstats.html>

## `ggwithinstats`

`ggbetweenstats` function has an identical twin function `ggwithinstats` for
repeated measures designs that behaves in the same fashion with a few minor
tweaks introduced to properly visualize the repeated measures design. As can be
seen from an example below, the only difference between the plot structure is
that now the group means are connected by paths to highlight the fact that these
data are paired with each other.


```r
# for reproducibility and data
set.seed(123)
library(WRS2)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggwithinstats(
  data = WRS2::WineTasting,
  x = Wine,
  y = Taste,
  sort = "descending", # ordering groups along the x-axis based on
  sort.fun = median, # values of `y` variable
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE,
  pairwise.display = "s",
  pairwise.annotation = "p",
  title = "Wine tasting",
  caption = "Data from: `WRS2` R package",
  ggtheme = ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight(),
  ggstatsplot.layer = FALSE,
  messages = FALSE
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggwithinstats1-1} 

As with the `ggbetweenstats`, this function also has a `grouped_` variant that
makes repeating the same analysis across a single grouping variable quicker. 


```r
# common setup
set.seed(123)

# getting data in tidy format
data_bugs <- ggstatsplot::bugs_long %>%
  dplyr::filter(.data = ., region %in% c("Europe", "North America"))

# plot
ggstatsplot::grouped_ggwithinstats(
  data = dplyr::filter(data_bugs, condition %in% c("LDLF", "LDHF")),
  x = condition,
  y = desire,
  xlab = "Condition",
  ylab = "Desire to kill an artrhopod",
  grouping.var = region,
  outlier.tagging = TRUE,
  outlier.label = education,
  ggtheme = ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight(),
  ggstatsplot.layer = FALSE,
  messages = FALSE
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggwithinstats2-1} 

### Summary of tests

Following (within-subjects) tests are carried out for each type of analyses-

Type | No. of groups | Test
----------- | --- | -------------------------
Parametric | > 2 | One-way repeated measures ANOVA
Non-parametric | > 2 | Friedman test
Robust | > 2 | Heteroscedastic one-way repeated measures ANOVA for trimmed means
Bayes Factor | > 2 | One-way repeated measures ANOVA
Parametric | 2 | Student's *t*-test
Non-parametric | 2 | Wilcoxon signed-rank test
Robust | 2 | Yuen's test on trimmed means for dependent samples
Bayes Factor | 2 | Student's *t*-test

The omnibus effect in one-way ANOVA design can also be followed up with more
focal pairwise comparison tests. Here is a summary of *multiple pairwise
comparison* tests supported in *ggwithinstats*-

Type | Test | *p*-value adjustment? 
---------------- | ---------------------------- | -----------
Parametric | Student's *t*-test | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}  
Non-parametric | Durbin-Conover test | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}  
Robust | Yuen's trimmed means test | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}  
Bayes Factor | \textcolor{red}{No} | \textcolor{red}{No}

For more, see the `ggwithinstats` vignette:
<https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/articles/web_only/ggwithinstats.html>

## `ggscatterstats`

This function creates a scatterplot with marginal distributions overlaid on the
axes (from `ggExtra::ggMarginal`) and results from statistical tests in the
subtitle:


```r
ggstatsplot::ggscatterstats(
  data = ggplot2::msleep,
  x = sleep_rem,
  y = awake,
  xlab = "REM sleep (in hours)",
  ylab = "Amount of time spent awake (in hours)",
  title = "Understanding mammalian sleep",
  messages = FALSE
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggscatterstats1-1} 

The available marginal distributions are-

  - histograms
  - boxplots
  - density
  - violin
  - densigram (density + histogram)

Number of other arguments can be specified to modify this basic plot-


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggscatterstats(
  data = dplyr::filter(.data = ggstatsplot::movies_long, genre == "Action"),
  x = budget,
  y = rating,
  type = "robust", # type of test that needs to be run
  conf.level = 0.99, # confidence level
  xlab = "Movie budget (in million/ US$)", # label for x axis
  ylab = "IMDB rating", # label for y axis
  label.var = "title", # variable for labeling data points
  label.expression = "rating < 5 & budget > 100", # expression that decides which points to label
  line.color = "yellow", # changing regression line color line
  title = "Movie budget and IMDB rating (action)", # title text for the plot
  caption = expression( # caption text for the plot
    paste(italic("Note"), ": IMDB stands for Internet Movie DataBase")
  ),
  ggtheme = hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_ps(), # choosing a different theme
  ggstatsplot.layer = FALSE, # turn off ggstatsplot theme layer
  marginal.type = "density", # type of marginal distribution to be displayed
  xfill = "#0072B2", # color fill for x-axis marginal distribution
  yfill = "#009E73", # color fill for y-axis marginal distribution
  xalpha = 0.6, # transparency for x-axis marginal distribution
  yalpha = 0.6, # transparency for y-axis marginal distribution
  centrality.para = "median", # central tendency lines to be displayed
  messages = FALSE # turn off messages and notes
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggscatterstats2-1} 

Additionally, there is also a `grouped_` variant of this function that makes it
easy to repeat the same operation across a **single** grouping variable. Also,
note that, as opposed to the other functions, this function does not return a
`ggplot` object and any modification you want to make can be made in advance
using `ggplot.component` argument (available for all functions, but especially
useful for this particular function):


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggstatsplot::grouped_ggscatterstats(
  data = dplyr::filter(
    .data = ggstatsplot::movies_long,
    genre %in% c("Action", "Action Comedy", "Action Drama", "Comedy")
  ),
  x = rating,
  y = length,
  label.var = title,
  label.expression = length > 200,
  conf.level = 0.99,
  k = 3, # no. of decimal places in the results
  xfill = "#E69F00",
  yfill = "#8b3058",
  xlab = "IMDB rating",
  grouping.var = genre, # grouping variable
  title.prefix = "Movie genre",
  ggtheme = ggplot2::theme_grey(),
  ggplot.component = list(
    ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 9, 1), limits = (c(2, 9)))
  ),
  messages = FALSE,
  nrow = 2,
  title.text = "Relationship between movie length by IMDB ratings for different genres"
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggscatterstats3-1} 

### Summary of tests

Following tests are carried out for each type of analyses. Additionally, the
correlation coefficients (and their confidence intervals) are used as effect
sizes-

Type | Test | CI?
----------- | ------------------------- | ---
Parametric | Pearson's correlation coefficient | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
Non-parametric | Spearman's rank correlation coefficient | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
Robust | Percentage bend correlation coefficient | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
Bayes Factor | Pearson's correlation coefficient | \textcolor{red}{No}

For more, see the `ggscatterstats` vignette:
<https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/articles/web_only/ggscatterstats.html>

## `ggpiestats`

This function creates a pie chart for categorical or nominal variables with
results from contingency table analysis (Pearson's $\chi^2$ test for
between-subjects design and McNemar's $\chi^2$ test for within-subjects design)
included in the subtitle of the plot. If only one categorical variable is
entered, results from one-sample proportion test (i.e., a $\chi^2$ goodness of
fit/gof test) will be displayed as a subtitle.

Here is an example of a case where the theoretical question is about proportions
for different levels of a single nominal variable:


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggpiestats(
  data = ggplot2::msleep,
  x = vore,
  title = "Composition of vore types among mammals",
  messages = FALSE
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggpiestats1-1} 

This function can also be used to study an interaction between two categorical
variables:


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggpiestats(
  data = mtcars,
  x = am,
  y = cyl,
  conf.level = 0.99, # confidence interval for effect size measure
  title = "Dataset: Motor Trend Car Road Tests", # title for the plot
  stat.title = "interaction: ", # title for the results
  legend.title = "Transmission", # title for the legend
  factor.levels = c("1 = manual", "0 = automatic"), # renaming the factor level names (`x`)
  facet.wrap.name = "No. of cylinders", # name for the facetting variable
  slice.label = "counts", # show counts data instead of percentages
  package = "ggsci", # package from which color palette is to be taken
  palette = "default_jama", # choosing a different color palette
  caption = substitute( # text for the caption
    paste(italic("Source"), ": 1974 Motor Trend US magazine")
  ),
  messages = FALSE # turn off messages and notes
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggpiestats2-1} 

In case of repeated measures designs, setting `paired = TRUE` will produce
results from McNemar's $\chi^2$ test-


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# data
survey.data <- data.frame(
  `1st survey` = c("Approve", "Approve", "Disapprove", "Disapprove"),
  `2nd survey` = c("Approve", "Disapprove", "Approve", "Disapprove"),
  `Counts` = c(794, 150, 86, 570),
  check.names = FALSE
)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggpiestats(
  data = survey.data,
  x = `1st survey`,
  y = `2nd survey`,
  counts = Counts,
  paired = TRUE, # within-subjects design
  conf.level = 0.99, # confidence interval for effect size measure
  package = "wesanderson",
  palette = "Royal1"
)
#> Note: 99% CI for effect size estimate was computed with 100 bootstrap samples.
#> # A tibble: 2 x 11
#>   `2nd survey` counts  perc N         Approve Disapprove statistic   p.value
#>   <fct>         <int> <dbl> <chr>     <chr>   <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>
#> 1 Disapprove      720   45  (n = 720) 20.83%  79.17%          245  3.20e- 55
#> 2 Approve         880   55. (n = 880) 90.23%  9.77%           570. 6.80e-126
#>   parameter method                                   significance
#>       <dbl> <chr>                                    <chr>       
#> 1         1 Chi-squared test for given probabilities ***         
#> 2         1 Chi-squared test for given probabilities ***
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggpiestats3-1} 

Note that when a two-way table is present (i.e., when both `x` and
`y` arguments are specified), *p*-values for results from one-sample
proportion tests are displayed in each facet in the form of asterisks with the
following convention: <br>

  - $***$: $p < 0.001$
  - $**$: $p < 0.01$
  - $*$: $p < 0.05$
  - $ns$: $p > 0.05$

Additionally, there is also a `grouped_` variant of this function that makes it
easy to repeat the same operation across a **single** grouping variable:


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggstatsplot::grouped_ggpiestats(
  dplyr::filter(
    .data = ggstatsplot::movies_long,
    genre %in% c("Action", "Action Comedy", "Action Drama", "Comedy")
  ),
  x = mpaa,
  grouping.var = genre, # grouping variable
  title.prefix = "Movie genre", # prefix for the facetted title
  label.text.size = 3, # text size for slice labels
  slice.label = "both", # show both counts and percentage data
  perc.k = 1, # no. of decimal places for percentages
  palette = "brightPastel",
  package = "quickpalette",
  messages = FALSE,
  nrow = 2,
  title.text = "Composition of MPAA ratings for different genres"
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggpiestats4-1} 

### Summary of tests

Following tests are carried out for each type of analyses-

Type of data | Design | Test
----------- | ------------ | -------------------------
Unpaired | $n \times p$ contingency table | Pearson's $\chi^{2}$ test
Paired | $n \times p$ contingency table | McNemar's $\chi^{2}$ test
Frequency | $n \times 1$ contingency table | Goodness of fit ($\chi^{2}$)

Following effect sizes (and confidence intervals/CI) are available for each type
of test-

Type | Effect size | CI?
--------------- | ------------------------- | --- 
Pearson's chi-squared test | CramÃ©r's *V* | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
McNemar's test | Cohen's *g*  | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
Goodness of fit | CramÃ©r's *V*  | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}

For more, see the `ggpiestats` vignette:
<https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/articles/web_only/ggpiestats.html>

## `ggbarstats`

In case you are not a fan of pie charts (for very good reasons), you can
alternatively use `ggbarstats` function which has a similar syntax-


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggbarstats(
  data = ggstatsplot::movies_long,
  x = mpaa,
  y = genre,
  sampling.plan = "jointMulti",
  title = "MPAA Ratings by Genre",
  xlab = "movie genre",
  perc.k = 1,
  x.axis.orientation = "slant",
  ggtheme = hrbrthemes::theme_modern_rc(),
  ggstatsplot.layer = FALSE,
  ggplot.component = ggplot2::theme(axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(face = "italic")),
  palette = "Set2",
  messages = FALSE
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggbarstats1-1} 

And, needless to say, there is also a `grouped_` variant of this function-


```r
# setup
set.seed(123)

# smaller dataset
df <- dplyr::filter(
  .data = forcats::gss_cat,
  race %in% c("Black", "White"),
  relig %in% c("Protestant", "Catholic", "None"),
  !partyid %in% c("No answer", "Don't know", "Other party")
)

# plot
ggstatsplot::grouped_ggbarstats(
  data = df,
  x = relig,
  y = partyid,
  grouping.var = race,
  title.prefix = "Race",
  xlab = "Party affiliation",
  ggtheme = ggthemes::theme_tufte(base_size = 12),
  ggstatsplot.layer = FALSE,
  messages = FALSE,
  title.text = "Race, religion, and political affiliation",
  nrow = 2
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggbarstats2-1} 

### Summary of tests

This is identical to the `ggpiestats` function summary of tests.

## `gghistostats`

In case you would like to see the distribution of a single variable and check if
it is significantly different from a specified value with a one sample test,
this function will let you do that.


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggstatsplot::gghistostats(
  data = iris, # dataframe from which variable is to be taken
  x = Sepal.Length, # numeric variable whose distribution is of interest
  title = "Distribution of Iris sepal length", # title for the plot
  caption = substitute(paste(italic("Source:", "Ronald Fisher's Iris data set"))),
  type = "parametric", # one sample t-test
  conf.level = 0.99, # changing confidence level for effect size
  bar.measure = "mix", # what does the bar length denote
  test.value = 5, # default value is 0
  test.value.line = TRUE, # display a vertical line at test value
  test.value.color = "#0072B2", # color for the line for test value
  centrality.para = "mean", # which measure of central tendency is to be plotted
  centrality.color = "darkred", # decides color for central tendency line
  binwidth = 0.10, # binwidth value (experiment)
  bf.prior = 0.8, # prior width for computing bayes factor
  messages = FALSE, # turn off the messages
  ggtheme = hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_tw(), # choosing a different theme
  ggstatsplot.layer = FALSE # turn off ggstatsplot theme layer
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-gghistostats1-1} 

Additionally, there is also a `grouped_` variant of this function that makes it
easy to repeat the same operation across a **single** grouping variable:


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggstatsplot::grouped_gghistostats(
  data = dplyr::filter(
    .data = ggstatsplot::movies_long,
    genre %in% c("Action", "Action Comedy", "Action Drama", "Comedy")
  ),
  x = budget,
  xlab = "Movies budget (in million US$)",
  type = "robust", # use robust location measure
  grouping.var = genre, # grouping variable
  normal.curve = TRUE, # superimpose a normal distribution curve
  normal.curve.color = "red",
  title.prefix = "Movie genre",
  ggtheme = ggthemes::theme_tufte(),
  ggplot.component = list( # modify the defaults from `ggstatsplot` for each plot
    ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 200, 50), limits = (c(0, 200)))
  ),
  messages = FALSE,
  nrow = 2,
  title.text = "Movies budgets for different genres"
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-gghistostats4-1} 

### Summary of tests

Following tests are carried out for each type of analyses-

Type | Test
----------- | -------------------------
Parametric | One-sample Student's *t*-test
Non-parametric | One-sample Wilcoxon test 
Robust | One-sample percentile bootstrap
Bayes Factor | One-sample Student's *t*-test

Following effect sizes (and confidence intervals/CI) are available for each type
of test-

Type | Effect size | CI?
----------- | ------------------------- | --- 
Parametric | Cohen's *d*, Hedge's *g* (central-and noncentral-*t* distribution based) | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
Non-parametric | *r* (computed as $Z/\sqrt{N}$) | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
Robust | $M_{robust}$ (Robust location measure) | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
Bayes Factor | \textcolor{red}{No} | \textcolor{red}{No}

For more, including information about the variant of this function
`grouped_gghistostats`, see the `gghistostats` vignette:
<https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/articles/web_only/gghistostats.html>

## `ggdotplotstats`

This function is similar to `gghistostats`, but is intended to be used when the
numeric variable also has a label.


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
ggdotplotstats(
  data = dplyr::filter(.data = gapminder::gapminder, continent == "Asia"),
  y = country,
  x = lifeExp,
  test.value = 55,
  test.value.line = TRUE,
  test.line.labeller = TRUE,
  test.value.color = "red",
  centrality.para = "median",
  centrality.k = 0,
  title = "Distribution of life expectancy in Asian continent",
  xlab = "Life expectancy",
  messages = FALSE,
  caption = substitute(
    paste(
      italic("Source"),
      ": Gapminder dataset from https://www.gapminder.org/"
    )
  )
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggdotplotstats1-1} 

As with the rest of the functions in this package, there is also a `grouped_`
variant of this function to facilitate looping the same operation for all levels
of a single grouping variable.


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# removing factor level with very few no. of observations
df <- dplyr::filter(.data = ggplot2::mpg, cyl %in% c("4", "6"))

# plot
ggstatsplot::grouped_ggdotplotstats(
  data = df,
  x = cty,
  y = manufacturer,
  xlab = "city miles per gallon",
  ylab = "car manufacturer",
  type = "nonparametric", # non-parametric test
  grouping.var = cyl, # grouping variable
  test.value = 15.5,
  title.prefix = "cylinder count",
  point.color = "red",
  point.size = 5,
  point.shape = 13,
  test.value.line = TRUE,
  ggtheme = ggthemes::theme_par(),
  messages = FALSE,
  title.text = "Fuel economy data"
)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggdotplotstats2-1} 

### Summary of tests

This is identical to summary of tests for `gghistostats`.

## ggcorrmat

`ggcorrmat` makes a correlalogram (a matrix of correlation coefficients) with
minimal amount of code. Just sticking to the defaults itself produces
publication-ready correlation matrices. But, for the sake of exploring the
available options, let's change some of the defaults. For example, multiple
aesthetics-related arguments can be modified to change the appearance of the
correlation matrix.


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# as a default this function outputs a correlalogram plot
ggstatsplot::ggcorrmat(
  data = ggplot2::msleep,
  corr.method = "robust", # correlation method
  sig.level = 0.001, # threshold of significance
  p.adjust.method = "holm", # p-value adjustment method for multiple comparisons
  cor.vars = c(sleep_rem, awake:bodywt), # a range of variables can be selected
  cor.vars.names = c(
    "REM sleep", # variable names
    "time awake",
    "brain weight",
    "body weight"
  ),
  matrix.type = "upper", # type of visualization matrix
  colors = c("#B2182B", "white", "#4D4D4D"),
  title = "Correlalogram for mammals sleep dataset",
  subtitle = "sleep units: hours; weight units: kilograms"
)

Note that if there are `NA`s present in the selected variables, the legend will
display minimum, median, and maximum number of pairs used for correlation tests.

There is a `grouped_` variant of this function that makes it
easy to repeat the same operation across a **single** grouping variable:


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# plot
# let's use only 50% of the data to speed up the process
ggstatsplot::grouped_ggcorrmat(
  data = dplyr::filter(
    .data = ggstatsplot::movies_long,
    genre %in% c("Action", "Action Comedy", "Action Drama", "Comedy")
  ),
  cor.vars = length:votes,
  corr.method = "np",
  colors = c("#cbac43", "white", "#550000"),
  grouping.var = genre, # grouping variable
  digits = 3, # number of digits after decimal point
  title.prefix = "Movie genre",
  messages = FALSE,
  nrow = 2
)
```

### Summary of tests

Following tests are carried out for each type of analyses. Additionally, the
correlation coefficients (and their confidence intervals) are used as effect
sizes-

Type | Test | CI?
----------- | ------------------------- | ---
Parametric | Pearson's correlation coefficient | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
Non-parametric | Spearman's rank correlation coefficient | \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}
Robust | Percentage bend correlation coefficient | \textcolor{red}{No}
Bayes Factor | Pearson's correlation coefficient | \textcolor{red}{No}

For examples and more information, see the `ggcorrmat` vignette:

## `ggcoefstats`

`ggcoefstats` creates a dot-and-whisker plot for regression models. Although the
statistical models displayed in the plot may differ based on the class of models
being investigated, there are few aspects of the plot that will be invariant
across models:

- The dot-whisker plot contains a dot representing the **estimate** and their
**confidence intervals** (`95%` is the default). The estimate can either be
  effect sizes (for tests that depend on the `F` statistic) or regression
  coefficients (for tests with `t` and `z` statistic), etc. The function will, by
  default, display a helpful `x`-axis label that should clear up what estimates are
  being displayed. The confidence intervals can sometimes be asymmetric if
  bootstrapping was used.
  
- The caption will always contain diagnostic information, if available, about
  models that can be useful for model selection: The smaller the Akaike's
  Information Criterion (**AIC**) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (**BIC**)
  values, the "better" the model is. Additionally, the higher the
**log-likelihood** value the "better" is the model fit.

- The output of this function will be a `ggplot2` object and, thus, it can be
  further modified (e.g., change themes, etc.) with `ggplot2` functions.



```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# model
mod <- stats::lm(formula = mpg ~ am * cyl, data = mtcars)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(x = mod, title = "linear model")
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggcoefstats1-1} 

This default plot can be further modified to one's liking with additional arguments
(also, let's use a robust linear model instead of a simple linear model now):


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# model
mod <- MASS::rlm(formula = mpg ~ am * cyl, data = mtcars)

# plot
ggstatsplot::ggcoefstats(
  x = mod,
  point.color = "red",
  point.shape = 15,
  vline.color = "#CC79A7",
  vline.linetype = "dotdash",
  stats.label.size = 3.5,
  stats.label.color = c("#0072B2", "#D55E00", "darkgreen"),
  title = "Car performance predicted by transmission & cylinder count",
  subtitle = "Source: 1974 Motor Trend US magazine",
  ggtheme = hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_ps(),
  ggstatsplot.layer = FALSE
) + # further modification with the ggplot2 commands
  ggplot2::scale_y_discrete(labels = c("transmission", "cylinders", "interaction")) +
  ggplot2::labs(x = "regression coefficient", y = NULL)
```


\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./figures/paper-ggcoefstats2-1} 

Most of the regression models that are supported in the `broom` and
`broom.mixed` packages with `tidy` and `glance` methods are also supported by
`ggcoefstats`. For example-

`aareg`, `anova`, `aov`, `aovlist`, `Arima`, `bigglm`, `biglm`, `brmsfit`,
`btergm`, `cch`, `clm`, `clmm`, `confusionMatrix`, `coxph`, `drc`, `emmGrid`,
`epi.2by2`, `ergm`, `felm`, `fitdistr`, `glmerMod`, `glmmTMB`, `gls`, `gam`,
`Gam`, `gamlss`, `garch`, `glm`, `glmmadmb`, `glmmPQL`, `glmmTMB`, `glmRob`,
`glmrob`, `gmm`, `ivreg`, `lm`, `lm.beta`, `lmerMod`, `lmodel2`, `lmRob`,
`lmrob`, `mcmc`, `MCMCglmm`, `mclogit`, `mmclogit`, `mediate`, `mjoint`, `mle2`,
`mlm`, `multinom`, `negbin`, `nlmerMod`, `nlrq`, `nls`, `orcutt`, `plm`, `polr`,
`ridgelm`, `rjags`, `rlm`, `rlmerMod`, `rq`, `speedglm`, `speedlm`, `stanreg`,
`survreg`, `svyglm`, `svyolr`, `svyglm`, etc.

Although not shown here, this function can also be used to carry out both
frequentist and Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis.

## Working with custom plots

Sometimes you may not like the defaults in a plot produced by `ggstatsplot`. In
such cases, you can use other custom plots (from `ggplot2` or other graphics
packages in `R`) and still use `ggstatsplot` functions to display results from relevant
statistical test.

For example, in the following chunk, we will create plot (*pirateplot*) using
`yarrr` package and use `ggstatsplot` function for extracting results.


```r
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# loading the needed libraries
library(yarrr)
library(ggstatsplot)

# using `ggstatsplot` to get call with statistical results
stats_results <-
  ggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats(
    data = ChickWeight,
    x = Time,
    y = weight,
    return = "subtitle",
    messages = FALSE
  )

# using `yarrr` to create plot
yarrr::pirateplot(
  formula = weight ~ Time,
  data = ChickWeight,
  theme = 1,
  main = stats_results
)
```

## Overall consistency in API

Attempt has been made to make the application program interface (API) consistent
enough that no struggle is expected while thinking about specifying function
calls-

  - When a given function depends on variables in a dataframe, `data` argument
    must always be specified.
  - Often, package functions relevant for between-subjects versus
    within-subjects design expect tidy/long versus Cartesian/wide format data,
    respectively. `ggstatsplot` functions consistently expect tidy/long form
    data. 
  - All functions accept both quoted (`x = "var1"`) and unquoted (`x = var1`)
    arguments.

![Consistent API](figures/arguments.png)

These set principles combined with the fact that almost all functions produce
publication-ready plots that require very few arguments if one finds the
aesthetic and statistical defaults satisfying make the syntax much less
cognitively demanding and easy to remember/reconstruct.

## Helpful messages and aesthetic modifications

`ggstatsplot` is a very chatty package and will by default print helpful notes
on assumptions about statistical tests, warnings, etc. If you don't want your
console to be cluttered with such messages, they can be turned off by setting
argument `messages = FALSE` in the function call.
  
All relevant functions in `ggstatsplot` have a `return` argument which can be
used to not only return plots (which is the default), but also to return a
`subtitle` or `caption`, which are objects of type `call` and can be used to
display statistical details in conjunction with a custom plot and at a custom
location in the plot.

Additionally, all functions share the `ggtheme` and `palette` arguments that can
be used to specify your favorite `ggplot` theme and color palette.
